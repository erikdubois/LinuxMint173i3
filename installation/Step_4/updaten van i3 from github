https://github.com/i3/i3

is the official github

May 2015 the version in linux mint 17.1 is 4.7.2
Githubs version is 4.10.2.

Many of the extra handy codes that work in Arch Linux latest version will not work in Linux Mint.

That is the only reason why I upgrade.

You do not have to do this.

Omit the lines that give an error in the older i3 if not already done so.
