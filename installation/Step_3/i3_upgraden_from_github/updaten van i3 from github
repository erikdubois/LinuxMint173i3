https://github.com/i3/i3

is the official github

January 1 2016 the version in linux mint 17.1 is 4.7.2-1
Githubs version is 4.11 !!!

Many of the extra handy codes that work in Arch Linux latest version will not work in Linux Mint.

That is the only reason why I upgrade.

You do not have to do this.

Omit the lines that give an error in the older i3 if not already done so.
