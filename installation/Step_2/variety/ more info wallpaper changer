In order to make it work on i3 we have to uncomment some lines.

Go to /home/your_username/.config/variety/scripts/set_wallpaper

change the codes

# Feh - commented, as it may cause problems with Nautilus, (see bug https://bugs.launchpad.net/variety/+bug/1047083)
feh --bg-scale "$WP" 2> /dev/null


Line 6 must work install feh!

you can change get_wallpaper same way

Example files are included  - these have the changed code inside of them.
